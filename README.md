## Description

This is a Word Guess game a simple version of a hangman style game implemented in JavaScript. 

**How to play:**

Press any Alpha key (A-Z, a-z) to start game. Non alpha keys are ignored. The theme of the game is 'Technology'. The game will randomly select a word from its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word.

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location.The game includes a countdown timer of 10 seconds for each word. Once the time runs out, the game will automatically proceed to the next word. If the player fails to guess a word within the time limit, the game will reveal the word and move on to the next one.

Each time the user correctly guesses a word, the game will increment a win counter.
